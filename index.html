					It should be easy to make my software service available to others. It's really easy if I can make my
					service public, and all data is shared between all users.
				</p>
				<p>
					But if I want to distinguish one user from one another, and perhaps I even need to know who they
					are. I
					could use an authentication mechanism.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will probably want to allow for administrative access, perhaps on multiple levels. The System
					Administrator should control system wide settings and have access to system wide report, while a
					Tenant Admininistrator should have tenant wide control. There could be a need for even more roles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Authentication will take me half way there. I will also need to handle <i>authorization</i> or
					<i>access control</i>. Ie. who can do what and who has access to what resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					It should be easy let people pay me for using my software. Of course, making people <i>want</i> to
					pay isn't always easy, but at least it shouldn't be a technical problem. How can I utilize a payment
					provider?
				</p>
				<p>
					There are more things to take care of. How do we handle logging and monitoring? Displaying
					dashboards and reports about our infrastructure, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					It turns out it is not so easy after all...

				<h2>What would I like to have?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A turnkey solution for "all the boring technical stuff before launching a product"
					</li>
					<li>
						An opinionated starter kit that sets up everything I need from well tried components.
						<br />
						Some suggested components are <a href="kubernetes.html">Kubernetes</a>, <a
							href="certificates.html">Lets Encrypt</a>, <a href="authentication.html">OpenID Connect</a>,
						<a href="authentication.html">Keycloak</a>, KrakenD, Seq,
						Prometheus, Graphana etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					... and it should let me start creating using the languages and frameworks that I know.
					<br />
					(For me that would be at least React, C#, Python.)
				</p>

			<article class="block blue">
				<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
				<p>
					For a SAAS solutions that suports either multi tenant or single tenant.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Infrastructure that is either self hosted or hosted by a provider, like AWS, Azure etc.
						<br>
						(Kubernetes seems like a good choice)
					</li>
					<li>
						API Gateway
					</li>
				</ul>

					It should not be opinionated about development tools, languages, framworks and runtimes that I can
					use

				<p>
					However, if you're ok with that, you should look into some of the <a
